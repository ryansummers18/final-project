# Week 1
 During week 1 I created a Bootstrap Carousel with five different images in it. The images are photos I took personally for professional use for The Gainesville Sun newspaper while covering weekly high school football events this semester. I also created my H1, included a byline and an introductory paragraph to my website above the Carousel. I have implemented a simple bootstrap theme via a css document (bootstrap-theme.min.css) and started formatting my webpage with my own design via style.css. The style.css file is not complete yet as I will continue to add style as I add more element to my page just for the style of the page and containing my divs. (Ex: HighCharts and Twitter embed) As my approved project proposal stated, this is what I will have had completed by this time for the final project. Mindy's comments on my proposal told me to look at and choose my bootstrap theme and I have chosen the free theme: Yeti from bootswatch.com and will be continuing to use it going forward. To help with my Bootstrap Carousel I watched this Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0nkkXkrby0. I hit a couple hiccups with my slider getting the caption to show up properly and to have the buttons in the ordered list work properly but I was able to fix them by reading my code line for line and addressing those issues. I have a problem with the slider when it is open on a wider screen there is empty space next to the images, but when it is brought into a smaller view (mobile) it looks fine. I like how this is starting to look but I will need to be extremely careful moving forward as I plan to hang information to the right side of my Carousel and want to also keep the page visually appealing.
